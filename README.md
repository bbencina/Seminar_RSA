# The RSA cryptosystem: uses, weaknesses and advantages

This repository contains my presentation and "article" about the RSA cryptosystem.
It is the main part of my second year university mathematics course Seminar.

Written in part as a basic guide to attacking a badly implemented RSA cipher with common solutions on how to fix general mistakes and exploit sources of the cryptosystem to assure maximum security.
